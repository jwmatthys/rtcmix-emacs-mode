;;; Commentary:

;; This is a mode for editing RTcmix language files and running them.

;; Information about the ChucK language can be found on
;; http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/

;; INSTALLATION AND USE :

;; To install, put this file on your load-path and the add a line with?
;; (require 'rtcmix-mode)

;; To start using it just edit a .sco file.  You can then press C-c C-c
;; (rtcmix-add-code) to send the buffer content to RTcmix.

;;; Code:

(require 'custom)

;;; Customizable variables
